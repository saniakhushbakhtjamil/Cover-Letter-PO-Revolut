# Sania Jamil - Motivation Letter for Product Owner (Website)
This project presents my cover letter for Revolut Product Owner Position

Hello Hiring Team,

Revolut’s mission to turn financial complexity into beautifully simple solutions strongly resonates with me. As both a customer and a Product Owner working across payments, web platforms, and system integrations, I’m excited about the opportunity to own and scale the Revolut Business website experience.

Over the past eight years in tech, I’ve worked at the intersection of product, engineering, and business, leading initiatives across payments (Klarna integration), chargebacks in Europe and North America, fraud detection, and consumer-facing web solutions. Most recently at Electrolux, I’ve owned a sales platform used across 12+ countries, where I defined product strategy and roadmap based on ROI, sales performance, and operational efficiency.

One of my most impactful initiatives was leading a full product migration from version 1 to version 2 of our in-house sales platform. Through structured discovery with users and deep technical collaboration with engineering, we redesigned the system architecture to improve scalability and reduce technical debt. The outcome:
- 40% reduction in operational support effort
- 20% fewer production incidents
- 30% improvement in development velocity
- 50% faster time-to-market
 
Beyond backend systems, I’ve launched customer-facing web solutions from scratch, including an online appointment booking platform integrated with CRM and field service systems. I’ve worked closely with UX to refine the customer journey, applied CRO principles and A/B testing to improve conversion, and partnered with data engineers to ensure reliable data pipelines across SAP CRM, FSM, and other enterprise systems.

What excites me most about this role is the combination of website ownership, growth optimisation, experimentation, and data architecture. I thrive in environments where product decisions are driven by analytics, where UX excellence directly impacts sign-ups, and where collaboration across marketing, engineering, and leadership shapes measurable business outcomes.

I would love the opportunity to contribute to scaling the Revolut Business website into a best-in-class growth engine.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Sania
